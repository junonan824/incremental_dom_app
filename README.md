## Introduction

Incremental DOM is an approach to DOM manipulation that updates the real DOM directly, bypassing the need to create a virtual DOM. This can lead to performance improvements in scenarios where small, frequent updates are necessary.

This project was created to showcase how Incremental DOM can be used in modern web development.
