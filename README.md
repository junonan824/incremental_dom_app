# Incremental DOM App

This project demonstrates the use of Incremental DOM, a technique for optimizing updates to the DOM by directly modifying it without creating an intermediate representation. This method can be particularly efficient for applications requiring frequent, small updates.

## Introduction

Incremental DOM is an approach to DOM manipulation that updates the real DOM directly, bypassing the need to create a virtual DOM. This can lead to performance improvements in scenarios where small, frequent updates are necessary.

This project was created to showcase how Incremental DOM can be used in modern web development.

## Setup

Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/junonan824/incremental_dom_app
   cd incremental-dom-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Code Overview

### index.html

This file sets up the basic HTML structure and includes the JavaScript module. 

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Incremental DOM Example</title>
</head>
<body>
  <div id="app"></div>
  <script type="module" src="./index.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

### index.js

This file contains the JavaScript code that uses `lit-html` to manage the Incremental DOM updates. It demonstrates a simple counter application that increments a number each time a button is clicked.

```javascript
import { html, render } from 'lit-html';

let count = 0;

const update = () => {
  const template = html`
    <h1>Incremental DOM Example</h1>
    <p>Count: ${count}</p>
    <button @click=${() => { count++; update(); }}>Increment</button>
  `;
  render(template, document.getElementById('app'));
};

update();
```

### bs-config.json

This configuration file is used by `lite-server` to serve the files and handle routing.

```json
{
  "server": {
    "baseDir": "./src",
    "routes": {
      "/node_modules": "node_modules"
    }
  }
}
```

### .gitignore

The `.gitignore` file ensures that certain files and directories are not included in your Git repository. This includes `node_modules` and various log files.

```plaintext
# Node modules
node_modules/

# Log files
npm-debug.log
yarn-debug.log
yarn-error.log

# IDE settings
.idea/
.vscode/
```

## Running the Application

To run the application locally, use:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the development server and open the application in your default web browser.

## CI/CD Setup

To set up continuous integration and deployment, you can use GitHub Actions. This will ensure that your project is built and tested on every push or pull request.

1. **Create a GitHub Actions workflow file**: Add a file named `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with the following content:

```yaml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master ]

jobs:
  build:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Use Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: '14'
    - run: npm install
    - run: npm run build --if-present
```

2. **Commit and push your changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Set up CI with GitHub Actions"
   git push origin master
   ```

This workflow will install dependencies and build your application whenever you push changes to the `master` branch or open a pull request targeting `master`.

## Conclusion

Incremental DOM offers a powerful and efficient way to manage DOM updates, making it an excellent choice for applications with frequent, small updates. Understanding its principles and implementation can significantly enhance your web development skills.
